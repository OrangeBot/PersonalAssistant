Why is this all so difficult

1) todoist v 0.1
    - track updates. store them. access them afterwards.
    - can todoist listen to updates or just poll regularly?
        Can listen but declared unreliable.
        step 1 - poll once a second
        step 2 also listen in between
        step 3 - poll once a minute, listen in between

2) ???
3) protobuf builder
Done 4) how to import my own pyutils
5) telegram
    - day stages/flags/triggers/events - need config
    - main pipeline button interactor - output
    - open form interactor - input
